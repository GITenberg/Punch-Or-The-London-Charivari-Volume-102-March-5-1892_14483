  <blockquote>Great is the might of the Meaningless! Especially in a
  rattling refrain or a rousing chorus. Big drum effects are always
  popular. What wonder clever Miss LOTTIE COLLINS'S
  "<i>Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay</i>!" is all the rage? "Her greatest creation"
  (<i>vide</i> advertisements), "sung and danced with the utmost
  <i>verve</i>," has taken the town. Will it "mar its use" to attach a

  <p><b>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</b>&mdash;Quoth one of the Baron's Assistants
  to his Chief, "Sir, those who love the personality, and venerate the
  memory of CHARLES DICKENS, will thank Miss HOGARTH who has selected, Mr.
  LAWRENCE HUTTON who has edited, and OSGOOD, MCILVAINE &amp; CO. who
  publish, a series of letters addressed by BOZ to WILKIE COLLINS. They
  bear date between the years 1851 and 1870, were found among COLLINS'S
  papers after his death, and prove not the least precious of his
  possessions. <i>Foster's Life of Dickens</i> will undoubtedly remain the
  medium through which the outer world shall know the great novelist."
  "True," interposes the Baron, "that certainly is one way in which
  admiration for the works of the great novelist will be foster'd among us.
  You agree? Of course you do. Proceed, sweet warbler, your observations
  interest me much." Whereupon the warbler thus addressed continued. "But,
  Sir, we are all conscious of a certain unpleasant taste those volumes
  leave in the mouth. Some of the incidents recorded, and many of the
  letters, present DICKENS with undue prominence in a possible phase of his
  character, as a ruthless tradesman in literature and lecturing, with some
  tendency to be overbearing in his social relations. In this little volume
  of letters to his old familiar friend we find him at his best, whether as
  a worker in literature or as a critic of other people's work."</p>

  task, and to advance along the path marked out for me by Heaven. To this
  are added the sense of responsibility to our Supreme Lord above, and my
  unshakable conviction that He, our former ally at Rossbach and Dennewitz,
  will not leave me in the lurch. He has taken such infinite pains with our
  ancient Brandenburg and our House, that we cannot suppose he has done

  pleasure I have received during my life from the society of your friends
  and <i>protégés</i>. I don't speak of mere material, meat-and-money
  advantages. Probably, if a strict account could be stated, it might be
  found that in these paltry matters a balance, large or small, was still
  due to me. Who knows? Strict accounts are hateful; and even if I did lose
  here and there I did it, I fancy, with my eyes open, and was not sorry to
  indulge these gentlemen with the idea that their fascinations had
  conquered me. No. What I speak of is rather the genuine pleasure I have
  derived from some of the finest acting (in ordinary life, not on the
  boards) that the world ever saw, acting in which I protest that the
  tears, the sighs, the misery, the gallantry, the courage, the loyal
  sentiments and the honourable promises all rang with so sincere a sound
  that the very actor himself was subdued like the dyer's hand to the
  colours he worked in, until he believed himself to be the most unjustly
  persecuted of mankind, the most upright of gentlemen, or whatever the
  special emotion he simulated required that he should seem to be for the
  moment. That he might possibly be what, as a matter of fact, he often
  was, a rogue and a knave, mattered little to me at the time. He was
  evidently himself ignorant of his potentialities, and in any case they
  could not spoil my æsthetic enjoyment of a notable performance. And after
  all who is to undertake to draw the line between the good man and the
  bad? I have known men with regard to whom I was convinced that they were
  admirably equipped by nature for a career of roguery; somewhere in the
  backs of their heads I know they carried a complete set of intellectual
  implements for the task, but no temptation, as it happened, ever came to
  open the door of that secret chamber, and the unconscious owners of it
  passed through life honoured by their fellow-citizens, and their actions
  still smell sweet and blossom in their dust. Others, of course, were not
  so fortunate. Their crisis pursued and captured them, revealed them to
  themselves and others, and in many cases only left them, alas, after
  cropping both their hair and their reputations. But I leave these
  divagations, which can have but little interest for you. What I rather
  wish to do is to recall to your memory the curious personality and the
  chequered adventures of our common friend, WILFRID COBBYN.</p>

      alt="Mr Wilfrid Cobbyn." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>I met him some six years ago when I was on a visit to my father's old
  friend, General TEMPEST, at Dansington. Most people, I take it, have
  heard of Dansington, that home of educational establishments, amusement,
  and retired Indian Generals. Old General TEMPEST&mdash;LEONIDAS
  MARLBOROUGH TEMPEST he had been christened by a warlike father, whose
  military aspirations had been crushed by the necessity for a commercial
  career, and who had taken it out of fate by devoting his son to heroism
  at the baptismal font, and by subsequently buying him a commission in a
  crack regiment&mdash;General TEMPEST was, in the days of which I speak, a
  hospitable veteran whose amiability and good-nature had survived many
  severe campaigns in which he had taken and given hard knocks wherever
  hard knocks were to be found. His benevolence and hospitality were
  proverbial far beyond the limits of Dansington, and his daughter CLARA
  was one of the prettiest girls in the United Kingdom.</p>

  <p>On the occasion of this visit I found a fellow guest, the identical
  WILFRID COBBYN whom I have already mentioned. He had been there for a
  fortnight, I learnt from ALEXANDER, the eldest hope of the TEMPESTS, and
  had made himself a favourite with every member of the family. How they
  got to know him I never quite discovered&mdash;indeed, I doubt if any of
  them could have told me&mdash;and as to his previous history all they
  seemed to know was that his father had property "somewhere in the West of
  England," that he himself had travelled a great deal, and was now close
  upon thirty years old. I am free to admit that after my first dinner in
  his company I had very little inclination to worry myself about the
  details of his past, so cheerful and fascinating did I find his gay
  companionship. I cannot quite explain the charm of the man. He had a
  roving blue eye, a ruddy and glowing complexion, and a laugh that seemed
  to kick all gloomy fancies into flinders, and to carry those who heard it
  in a helter-skelter gallop of mirth. And then what stories the fellow
  could tell! He had the General and me in perpetual convulsions, and even
  ALEXANDER, a somewhat awkward and taciturn youth, much weighed down by
  the responsibilities of his freshmanhood at Oxford, was pleased to unbend
  and smile approvingly at the amazing sallies of the wizard COBBYN.</p>

  <p>One story I remember in particular, though I dare not attempt to
  repeat it as COBBYN told it. It was about the wretched adventures of a
  certain travelling companion of his on a shooting expedition in Albania.
  It was a story that never seemed to cease,&mdash;a bad recommendation for
  most stories, I admit; but in this case so artfully and with such
  surprising humour and force was it told, so vividly did it depict a long
  series of ludicrous sufferings culminating in the total loss of the
  sufferer's clothes and his involuntary appearance in the full uniform of
  a Turkish Zaptieh, with other surprising and endless episodes, that at
  the last we had in the midst of our gasps of helpless laughter to implore
  the narrator to stop for the sake of our sides and the resounding rafters
  of the General's house.</p>

  <p>At other times the irresistible WILFRID would pose reminiscently as
  the gallant protector of outraged virtue, or as the hero of some
  deathless story of courage and coolness by which empires had been saved
  from disaster. And he was so persuasive, so convincing, that our
  imaginations, which would have refused to follow a smaller man on lower
  flights, soared obediently after him through an empyrean of impossible
  romance. Nor did he stop at this. General TEMPEST was the pattern of
  old-world punctilio, but before a week was out he had introduced COBBYN,
  of whom he knew nothing except what COBBYN told him, to all the best
  people in Dansington; nor shall I ever forget the air with which this
  glorious rascal took the portly old Countess of CARDAMUMS down to her
  second supper at the County Ball. He rode ALEXANDER'S chestnut, and
  ALEXANDER never murmured. The General's ancient retainer went on his many
  errands, and neither the General nor his man saw anything out of the way
  in the proceeding. Even CLARA looked, I thought, with some
  favour&mdash;but as CLARA always breaks into indignant denials whenever
  this is hinted, I will proceed no further. As for the members of the
  Dansington Club they were enthusiastic in COBBYN'S praises. The young
  sparks imitated his fashions in ties and collars, the old bucks repeated
  to one another his stories, and one and all vowed he was "an uncommon
  good fellow, by Gad."</p>

  <p>To me COBBYN was always profusely polite, with that flattering
  politeness which induces the flattered to think himself just a shade
  cleverer and sharper and better than his fellow-creatures, and on the day
  before my departure he honoured me by borrowing a ten-pound note of me
  and writing my London address with much ceremony on the back of an
  envelope, which I afterwards found lying about in a passage of the
  General's house.</p>

  <p>Three months afterwards there was a tempest in Dansington. COBBYN had
  gone away for two days and had stayed away for good. His intimates and
  the Dansington tradesmen became uneasy, rumours began to spread, and the
  result was a crash which made some very knowing fellows look extremely
  foolish, and filled the Club with honest British imprecations. Little TOM
  SPINDLE, who commanded a troop of the Fallowshire Yeomanry (the Duke of
  DASHBOROUGH'S Hussars) and had the reputation of spending a royal income
  with beggarly meanness, had backed one of COBBYN'S bills for £1,000. Sir
  PAUL PACKTHREAD, one of the greatest of the local magnates, had lent him
  £500 without a scrap of security, and Colonel CHUTNEY had put £300 into
  the Ephemeral Soapsuds Company, Limited, of which COBBYN was to have been
  the managing director. I cannot go through the whole long list. He had
  fleeced all that was fleeceable in Dansington, and had vanished into the
  clouds. How he managed to do it, by what artful proposals he conquered
  the avarice of SPINDLE, prevailed over the mercantile sagacity of
  PACKTHREAD, and subdued the fiery temper of CHUTNEY, will never be known.
  Partly, no doubt, he succeeded by being here and there perfectly truthful
  and candid. He <i>was</i> the son of a well-to-do country Squire, but the
  father had long since ejected his offspring from the paternal mansion; he
  had really travelled and had often displayed pluck. But his chief gifts
  were his good-humour, his ardent imagination, and a persuasive tongue
  that gained for him the trusting confidence of his victims almost before
  he himself knew that he meant to victimise them.</p>

  <p>They tell me he is now established somewhere in the West of America.
  Wherever he goes he is sure to be popular&mdash;for a time.</p>

<h3>HOW TO SAVE LONDON.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Rather more than a Fairy Story.</i>)</p>

  <p>JOHN SMITH, of London, sat in front of his fire pondering over the
  fact that, at a great sacrifice to the interests of his native city, the
  coal dues had been abolished, and yet his bill for fuel was no lighter.
  He watched the embers as they died away, when all of a sudden a small
  creature appeared before him. He could not account for her presence, and
  did not notice from whence she came. But she was there, sure enough, and
  began to address him.</p>

  <p>"JOHN SMITH, of London," she began, in a small but admirably distinct
  voice, "I am the Fairy Domestic Economy, and I have come to warn you
  that, unless you wake up, you will come to grief."</p>

  <p>"Wake up?" queried J.S. "Wake up about what?"</p>

  <p>"Why, the election of the London County Council, to be sure!" returned
  the Fairy, impatiently. "Here, the election is close upon you, and the
  chances are twenty to one that you will let it pass without recording
  your vote." "What election?"</p>

  <p>"Bless the man!" exclaimed the Fairy. "He does not know that the
  Members of the L.C.C., the Masters of London, are to be chosen on
  Saturday, the 5th of March, and will from that date remain in power for
  four years!"</p>

  <p>And then the Fairy showed him the possible future, explaining that it
  was in his hands to alter it. The vision she conjured up before him
  seemed intensely idiotic. Everything was to be done for nothing. There
  were to be free railways, free tramways, free bakeries, free butchers'
  shops, free ginger-beer manufactories, free clothiers, free hosiers, free
  boot-makers, free gas companies, free waterworks&mdash;in fact,
  everything was to be gratis.</p>

  <p>"But somebody must pay for it!" said JOHN SMITH, of London.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course," returned the Fairy, "and you are to be the
  paymaster. You will have to pay about five shillings in the pound as a
  commencement, with additional crowns to follow!"</p>

  <p>"But how am I to avoid this fate?" cried JOHN SMITH, in a tone of
  genuine alarm.</p>

  <p>"By voting for the Moderates, and doing your best to keep out the
  Progressives. And, mind, don't forget my warning."</p>

  <p>And then the Fairy disappeared. A few moments later, and poor JOHN
  SMITH found himself sprawling upon the floor.</p>

  <p>"Why, I do believe I have been asleep!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>And then he woke up in good earnest, and hurried off to the polling
  stations, and voted for the Moderate candidates.</p>

  <p>At least it is to be hoped he will!</p>

<h3>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h3>

<p class="center">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

  <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, February 21.</i>&mdash;"What a day he
  <i>is</i> having to be sure!" murmured the SQUIRE OF MALWOOD, looking
  across the table at the other eminent country gentleman who is our First
  Minister of Agriculture.</p>

  <p>Truly a great occasion for CHAPLIN, and he rose to its full height.
  Just the same man he was six years ago when he from same place, drew
  lurid picture of the Empire staggering to its doom overweighted with
  Small Holdings. Now he is bringing in a Bill to establish Small Holdings,
  and recommends the expedient to House as crowning edifice of Empire's
  prosperity. At such a crisis some men would have blushed, however
  entirely foreign to their habit the pretty weakness might be. CHAPLIN, on
  contrary, made out in vague, but luminous, manner that he had been right
  in both instances. Indeed, the anxious listener had conveyed to him the
  conviction, still vague but not less irresistible, that this direct
  contradiction was peculiarly creditable to the Right Hon. Gentleman
  addressing the House, displaying a flexibility of genius not common to
  mankind.</p>

  <p>CHAPLIN always looms large on whatever horizon he may appear.
  To-night, standing at Table introducing Small Holdings Bill, he seemed to
  swell wisibly before our eyes. Prince ARTHUR early in progress of the
  speech observed precaution of moving lower down Bench. By similar
  strategic movement, HENRY MATTHEWS drew nearer to Gangway. Thus CHAPLIN
  was, so to speak, planted out in Small Holding exclusively his own.</p>

  <p>House anxious to hear particulars of Government measure, CHAPLIN,
  remembering old times when they used to jeer at his sonorous commonplaces
  uttered below Gangway, took a pretty revenge. Out of oration of
  fifty-five minutes duration, he appropriated twenty-five to general
  observations prefacing exposition of clauses of Bill. Just the same kind
  of pompous platitude conveyed in turgid phraseology, at which, in old
  times, Members used to laugh and run away. But CHAPLIN had them now. Like
  the wedding guest whom the Ancient Mariner button-holed&mdash;though as
  PLUNKET reminds me, the A.M. was meagre in frame, and CHAPLIN is
  not&mdash;the House could not help but hear. Once, when the orator
  dropped easily into autobiographical episode, described himself strolling
  about the fields of Lincolnshire, turning up a turnip here, drawing forth
  a casual carrot there, meditating on the days when</p>

  <p>But it was very beautiful, and those who, from natural taste, inborn
  prejudice, or lamentable ignorance, did not care for it themselves, could
  not fail to enjoy the supreme delight the occasion brought to the
  Minister of Agriculture.</p>

  <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Small Holdings Bill introduced.</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Two Right Rev. Bishops, Lord Bishop of ST. ASAPH
  and he of SALISBURY, in Peers' Gallery for two or three hours tonight;
  attracted by debate on Welsh Disestablishment. Bishop of SALISBURY
  couldn't restrain his astonishment at scene.</p>

  <p>"One of the profoundest and most important questions of the day," he
  whispered in his right reverend brother's ear. "It is the attack upon the
  outworks. Wales carried by the Liberation Society, we shall have them
  leaping over the palings into our preserves. Should have thought, now,
  the House of Commons would have been seething with excitement; benches
  crowded; all the Princes of Debate to the fore; cheers and counter-cheers
  filling the place. Whereas there are not, I should say, more than
  eighteen Members present whilst the stout Gentleman down there is
  demonstrating how much happier Wales is under the benediction of the
  Church than she would be without. The whole thing reminds me, dear ST.
  ASAPH, of&mdash;er&mdash;well, of an eight o'clock morning service in
  inclement weather."</p>

  <p>"You're young, brother SARUM," said ST. ASAPH, "young, of course I
  mean, in contradistinction to Old Sarum. When you've been a little longer
  in Parliamentary life, you'll understand things better. These empty
  benches, and the general appearance of being horribly bored presented by
  the small congregation&mdash;which I may say finds eloquent expression on
  the face of our friend JOHN G. TALBOT&mdash;simply mean that they have
  heard all these speeches before, and have made up their minds on the
  subject. They are ready to vote, but they will not remain to hear the
  speeches. As you say, in such circumstances it would appear more
  businesslike to take the vote at once, and get along with other work. But
  that is unparliamentary. This will be kept going till there is just time
  left before the adjournment to divide. <i>Then</i> you'll see how dear is
  this question to the hearts of our friends, and how virulent is the
  persistence of the adversary."</p>

  <p>Turned out exactly as the Lord Bishop had said. After half-past ten,
  Members trooped down in scores. When Prince ARTHUR rose to continue the
  debate he was hailed with ringing cheer from embattled host. Pretty to
  see how gentlemen to right of SPEAKER, mustered for defence of the
  Church, were careful to contribute to fitness of things by wearing the
  clerical white tie.</p>

  <p>"Very nice indeed of them," said Young SARUM, rarely out so late at
  night, but drawn back, after light repast, to watch the division taken.
  "I could wish that, instead of the superabundance of shirt-front
  displayed, our friends had selected more closely-buttoned vests, and that
  their coat-collar fitted a little higher. But we cannot have perfection,
  and the white tie at least indicates nice feeling."</p>

  <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Proposal to disestablish Church in Wales
  negatived by 267 Votes against 220.</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;PROVAND moved Second Reading Shop Hours' Bill,
  and, what's more, carried it against Ministers. CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN tells
  me that, though Scotch Members voted for Bill, result has cast a gloom
  over them. Expecting PROVAND would lose, they were all prepared to say,
  in casual way, "Ah, well, so the case is non-PROVAND." Some had, indeed,
  gone so far as commence to write letters home enshrining this joke. These
  are now, of course, waste-paper. Pity opportunity lost. Scotch language
  not rich in provision of similar openings for wit.</p>

  <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Second Reading Shop Hours' Bill carried.
  Rare opportunity for Scotch joke hopelessly lost.</p>

  <p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;MIDLETON brought London Fog on again in Lords
  to-night. Asked the MARKISS if he would have any objection to appointment
  of Joint Committee to inquire into the matter? The MARKISS a great artist
  in words; suits his conversation to the topic. His reply decidedly misty;
  wouldn't say yes or no; talked about Joint Committees being a mysterious
  part of the Constitution; didn't know how they were to be appointed;
  hinted at rupture with Commons if proposal were made; wound up by saying
  that if Motion for Committee were submitted, he would do his best to
  induce their Lordships to adopt it.</p>

  <p>Strangers in Gallery puzzled by this speech. But the Lords know all
  about it. STRATHEDEN winked at CAMPBELL, and both noble Lords wagged
  their head in admiration of MARKISS'S diplomacy; recognise deep design in
  involved speech and well affected hesitation.</p>

  <p>MARKISS, I hear, vexed with me letting the cat&mdash;I mean the fog,
  out of the bag last week. But it's everybody's secret. The Government
  have made up their mind to go to the country on the London Fog. This
  Joint Committee will be appointed with least possible delay; a measure
  based on its Report will be carried through both Houses; everything will
  be ready for return of unsuspecting Fog Fiend next November.</p>

  <p>"Sorry you mentioned it prematurely, TOBY," the MARKISS said, not
  unkindly. "But you only forestalled the announcement by a few days. It's
  been in my mind for months. The cry of Separation is growing a little
  shrill; Free Education hasn't done us any good; Small Holdings only
  so-so. The Fog's the thing! Grappling with that, all London rallies to
  our standard, and with London at our back we can face the country."</p>

  completely is mind of Her Majesty's Ministers occupied with this Fog
  problem, that to-night it got into House of Commons. LORD ADVOCATE
  brought in Bill allocating Scotch Local Taxation grant. Debate went on
  for six hours; at end of that time discovered that whole proceedings
  irregular. As involving money question, introduction of Bill should have
  been preceded by Resolution submitted to Committee of whole House. Debate
  abruptly adjourned; evening wasted; howls of derision from Radicals.</p>

  <p>"Never mind," said Prince ARTHUR, cheerily. "Let those laugh who win.
  This is only another argument (perhaps not so accidental and undesigned
  as people think) in support of our new Fog policy."</p>

  <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Night wasted in Commons. In Lords, light
  looms behind the Fog.</p>

  <p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;News of Mr. G. speeding home over land and sea.
  All his friends on Front Bench been begging him to stay longer in the
  Sunny South. No need whatever for his return; things going on admirably;
  not missed in the least; shocking weather here; better stay where he
  is.</p>

  <p>"Ho, indeed!" said Mr. G., pricking up his ears and a dangerous light
  flashing under his eyebrows. "I'm not wanted, ain't I? SQUIRE OF MALWOOD
  getting along admirably in my shoes; doing well without me; not missed in
  the slightest. Very well, then; <i>I'll go home.</i>"</p>

  <p>MACLURE, who has been in the confidence of great statesmen from DIZZY
  downward, tells me Mr. G.'s homeward flight was hastened by curious
  dream. Dreamt all his sheep were straying from fold; some going one way,
  others another; each bent on his own particular business. In vain Mr. G.
  leaping up and taking crook in hand, put hand to mouth and halloed them
  back to Home-Rule fold. They went their way, some even making for
  Unionist encampment, where Mr. G., moving heavily in his slumber,
  distinctly saw one sheep regarding scene through an eyeglass.</p>

  <p>"Only a dream of course," Mr. G. said, when he set off in the morning
  for a twenty-mile walk. "But I think I may as well be getting back. Made
  up for the Session; fit for anything. Nothing could have been kinder or
  more watchful than Nurse RENDEL'S care of me; if I had been his son
  (which I admit is chronologically difficult), couldn't have been better
  done to. Only concerned just now for ARMITSTEAD. That young fellow, proud
  of his chickenhood of sixty-seven years, brought me out to take care of
  me, and freshen me up. Fancy I've worn <i>him</i> out; instead of his
  taking care of me, have to look after him! Shall be glad to get again
  within sound of Big Ben. Spoiling for a fight. HARCOURT done very well;
  but he'll have to tuck in his tuppenny and let me over into the Leader's
  place."</p>

  <p>"THE MEETING OF THE WATERS."&mdash;The Engineers of London and
  Birmingham have been requested, says the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, to "lay
  their heads together," so as to see if an amicable arrangement cannot be
  effected. This is an instance where to have "water on the brain" is
  absolutely necessary. Odd to think that in this "water difficulty" are
  contained all the elements of a burning question; so much so indeed, that
  the Engineers who may be clever enough to solve the problem without

  my lightening them by taking some of the gold off, and keeping it? This
  would form a nice little "metallic reserve" for me, a thing which Mr.

<h3>THE PRIVATE AND THE PUBLIC.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>What it may come to.</i>)</p>

  <blockquote>["If we are obliged to go into the open market for our
  soldiers, and compete with other employers of labour, we must bid as
  highly as they do, in pay, hours of work, and general conditions and
  comfort."&mdash;<i>Daily Paper on the Report of Lord Wantage's
  Committee.</i>]</blockquote>

<p class="center">SCENE&mdash;<i>A Public Place.</i></p>

<p class="center">Sergeant KITE <i>and a</i> Possible Recruit <i>in conversation.</i></p>

  <p><i>Sergeant Kite</i> (<i>continuing</i>). Then you must remember that
  we are exceedingly generous in the matter of rations.</p>

  <p><i>Possible Recruit</i> (<i>pained</i>). <i>Rations</i>! I suppose you
  mean <i>courses</i>! I find that in all the large firms in London the
  assistants have a dinner of six courses served, with cigars and coffee to
  follow. I couldn't think of joining the Army unless I had the same.</p>

  <p><i>Sergeant K.</i> (<i>with suppressed emotion</i>). If it must be so,
  then it must. Who's to pay the piper, <i>I</i> don't know! The Public, I
  suppose.</p>

  <p><i>P. R.</i> I should think so! Then as to drills. Really the number
  of these useless formalities should be largely decreased, and the hours
  at which they are held should be fixed with greater regard to the
  convenience of private soldiers. By the bye, of course I need hardly
  mention that I should not dream of enlisting unless it was agreed that I
  should never be called before 9.30 A.M. My early cup of tea and
  shaving-water might be brought to me at nine.</p>

  <p><i>Sergeant K.</i> (<i>after an interval</i>). Called! Early cup of
  tea! Shaving-water! Oh, this is <i>too</i> much!</p>

  <p><i>P.R.</i> (<i>coolly</i>). Not at all, my dear Sir, not half enough.
  There are other points I wish to mention. For example, do you allow
  feather-beds?</p>

  <p><i>Sergeant K.</i> Feather-beds!</p>

  <p><i>P.R.</i> Yes. A <i>sine quâ non</i>, I assure you. Then as to pay
  and pensions, and length of service. I would only accept an engagement by
  the month, with liberty to terminate it at any time with a week's
  notice.</p>

  <p><i>Sergeant K.</i> (<i>with sarcasm</i>). And you would wish to retire
  at a week's notice if war were declared?</p>

  <p><i>P.R.</i> (<i>surprised</i>). Certainly! Why not? "Peace with
  Honour" would be my motto. As to pay, of course you know what I could get
  if I went in for civil employment?</p>

  <p><i>Sergeant K.</i> No, I don't, and I don't see what that has to do
  with it. You surely would not compare the QUEEN'S service with the work
  of a beggarly counter-jumper?</p>

  <p><i>P.R.</i> Yes, I would. And as I could earn five shillings a-day
  easily in a shop, why, you will have to give me that, with a pension (as
  I might do better) of ten shillings a-day after six years' service.</p>

  <p><i>Sergeant K.</i> Any other point you would like to mention?</p>

  <p><i>P.R.</i> Yes, there is one other. Why should a labourer be able to
  get damages from his employer when injured, and a soldier be unable? The
  principle of the Employers' Liability Act must be extended to the Army,
  so that if any Commanding Officer made some stupid blunder in battle, as
  he probably would do, and I were to be hurt in consequence, I might sue
  him when we got back to England. You understand my point?</p>

  <p><i>Sergeant K.</i> Oh, quite! But what would there be to prevent every
  soldier present at the battle from suing also?</p>

  <p><i>P.R.</i> Nothing at all. Of course they <i>would</i> all sue. So no
  General must be permitted to go into action without first of all
  depositing in the High Court at home security for costs if
  defeated,&mdash;say half a million or so.</p>

  <p><i>Sergeant K.</i> (<i>with forced politeness</i>). Well, I'm glad to
  have heard your views. I'll mention them to my Colonel. They are sure to
  please him.</p>

  <p><i>P.R.</i> Yes, but don't keep me waiting long for his reply. My
  offer only remains open till to-morrow morning.</p>

  <p><i>Sergeant K.</i> Oh&mdash;!</p>

  <p>[<i>The remainder of the gallant</i> Sergeant's <i>observations are
  not necessary for publication, neither would they be accepted as a
  guarantee of his good faith. Exit to recruit.</i></p>

  </div>
  <p>FROM very early days, the days, or nights, of <i>The Battle of
  Waterloo</i> and <i>Scenes in the Circle</i>, with the once-renowned
  WIDDICOMB as Master of the Ring, <i>Mr. Punch</i> has ever been
  particularly fond of the old-fashioned equestrian entertainment. The Ring
  to which he has just made allusion is, it need hardly be added, The
  Circus, and The Book is a novel by Miss AMYE READE. <i>Mr. P.</i> is not
  sweet upon any gymnastic and acrobatic shows in which the chances of
  danger appear, and probably are, as ten to one against the performer; and
  especially does he object to children of very tender years being utilised
  in order to earn money for their parents or guardians by exhibiting their
  precocious agility. <i>Mr. P.</i> approves of the ancient use of the
  birch as practised at Eton a quarter of a century ago, and he is quite of
  the Wise Man's opinion as to the evil consequences of sparing the rod;
  which proverbial teaching, had it been practically and judiciously
  applied to Master SOLOMON himself (the ancient King, not the modern
  Composer) in his earliest years, would probably have prevented his going
  so utterly to the bad in the latter part of his life. So much, as far as
  corporal punishment is concerned, for the education of youth, whether in
  or out of the circus school. But girls, as well as boys, are trained for
  this circus business, gaining their livelihood by acrobatic performances.
  Does <i>Mr. Punch</i>, representing the public generally, quite approve
  of this portion of circus and acrobatic training? To this he can return
  only a qualified answer. His approval would depend, first, on the natural
  but extraordinary capability of the female pupil, and, secondly, the
  method of training her. As a rule, he would prefer to keep her out of it
  altogether: and, as to the boys, he certainly would defer their public
  appearance until they were at least sixteen; their previous training
  having been under the supervision of a responsible inspector. Then as to
  the training of animals for the circus business. If the training system
  means "all done by kindness," that is, by unflinching firmness and a just
  application of a considerately devised system of equally balanced rewards
  and punishments, then <i>Mr. P.</i> approves; but where cruelty comes in,
  whether in the training of child or beast, <i>Mr. Punch</i> would have
  such trainer of youth punished as <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> punished
  <i>Squeers</i>, in addition to imprisonment and fine; and for cruelty to
  dumb animals <i>Mr. P.</i> would order the garotter's punishment and
  plenty of it. Having professed this faith, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, after thus
  "arguing in a Circle," returns to his starting-point, and would like to
  know how much of truth there is in Miss AYME READE'S story entitled,
  <i>Slaves of the Sawdust</i>? As literature it is poor stuff, but as
  written with a purpose, and that purpose the exposing of alleged
  systematic cruelty in training children and dumb animals for the
  circus-equestrian acrobatic life, the book should not only attract
  general notice, but should also lead to a Commission of inquiry, or to
  some united action of all responsible circus-managers against the author
  of this work, which would result in either the said managers or the
  authoress being "brought to book." <i>Mr. Punch</i> hath spoken. <i>Verb.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
